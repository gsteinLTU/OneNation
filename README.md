# OneNation
![](https://travis-ci.com/gsteinLTU/OneNation.svg?branch=master)

A game of categorical elimination and geographical guessing. You will receive a series of clues that describe a country. Each time you name a country that fits all the clues so far, you will be given another clue. In the end, only one nation will be the correct answer. Find it to win!

Based on [these quizzes](https://www.jetpunk.com/user-quizzes/176412/category-elimination-countries) I saw on various quiz sites.

## Current Status

Almost working! The game is mostly playable, but it isn't handling states properly.
